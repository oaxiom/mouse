This work reanalyses the data, but for more recent genome annotations, and for transposable elements.

The work is essentially as described in the manuscript, but RSEM and bowtie are replaced with STAR and te_count

You will need:
Python >3.6: with a typical suite of computational tools: scipy, numpy, scikitlearn, etc.
